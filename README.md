## Load OS

Before you begin assembly, load the latest [Raspbian Jessie with Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). You will need to configure using a hdmi monitor and keyboard/mouse. Once you have networking and ssh running, you can begin assembly. Once the Adafruit LCD is working, the HDMI port doesn't work anymore, and the case does not provide access to it.

Use `raspbi-config` to:

- Expand the file system
- Set the locals for keyboard, and language
- Set the timezone
- Enable ssh
- Auto login to Desktop (optional)
- Enable VNC Server

If you have a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse, it's a good idea to get it connected now. I prefer [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015J6TEN8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) one over [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZL1IQA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1), I find it easier to type on.

## Assembly

![step 1](images/assembly-step1.jpg)

- Place the sd card with your configured raspbian image in your RPi.
- Put the Kippah board on the RPi.
- Attach the display extension ribbon cable to the Kippah board.
- Put the assembled RPi into the picase.

![step 2](images/assembly-step2.jpg)

- Press the M2.5 nuts into the tablet bottom recesses.
- Feed the display extension ribbon cable into the tablet bottom.
- Use the 20mm M2.5 screws to attach the picase to the tablet bottom.

![step 3](images/assembly-step3.jpg)

- Attach the display extension board to the LCD ribbon cable. The trick with the extension board is the tension bars flip up, not away as on the Kippah board. The extension board is much easier to connect to than the Kippah
- Use some scotch tape on both sides of the extension board to hold the board in place. Fold the tape over so it's easy to remove from the LCD (for the next step).

![step 4](images/assembly-step4.jpg)

- Put the LCD in the tablet back so the extension ribbon cable can reach the extension board.
- Attach the extension ribbon to the extension board and tape it to the LCD so there is no flex on the LCD ribbon.

![step 5](images/assembly-step5.jpg)

- Rotate the LCD so it's laying in the notches in the tablet bottom. Be careful not to twist the LCD ribbon cable. You will need to fold the extension ribbon cable in the gap below the LCD.

![step 6](images/assembled-front.jpg)

- Use the 4mm M2.5 screws to attach the tablet front. Make sure the notch for the LCD is clean as anything pressing on the LCD can cause issues with the touchscreen.

![step 7](images/assembled-back.jpg)

- Connect the 6 inch micro usb cable from the Kippah board, _not to the RPi power connection_.
- Connect a power cable and begin installation of the Kippah drivers.

## Installation

Follow the instructions on [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dpi-display-kippah-ttl-tft). If you have issues using the touchscreen calibration script, use `xinput-calibrator`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install xinput-calibrator
DISPLAY=:0.0 sudo xinput_calibrator
```

You need to place the settings into a calibration file. For Raspbian Jessie, use `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf`

You will need create the `xorg.conf.d` directory and place the config settings into a `99-calibration.conf` file.

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf
sudo reboot
```
